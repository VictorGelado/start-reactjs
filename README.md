## My process

### Built with

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Database
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I started with the basics, I still have a lot to learn. I learned:
- Use routes
- Make requests to the database
- Create components
- Use styles in javascript
- Login users
- Use 'useState'

And many more. All I learned was the basics, but I'm going to go further and further.

### Useful resources
